# Workout-Tracker

For this assignment I was given the front end code for a Workout Tracking application. I was tasked with using the given seeds to create a MongoDB database, create an exercise model, and create both the HTML routes and API routes. The user is able to view their last exercise on the home screen and either update it or create a new exercise log. If they create a new exercise, the user can add an exercise by choosing if it is either "Resistance" or "Cardio," then including the conent of the exercise such as time, reps, weight, distance, etc. When the user is finished, they can either choose to add another exercise to that day's workout or complete it. Once complete, it will be stored in the MongoDB database. The user can then view a detailed breakdown of their previous workouts on the dashboard, showing them the previous 7 days worth of exercises.

The application uses Express, Mongoose, Morgan, and Mongojs npm packages.
